       <li> 3 teaspoon yoghurt (curd)</li>
       <li>refined oil as required</li>

        <h5><b>  Instructions:</b></h5>

        <i>Preparing Chole (Chickpea Curry):</i>
 <br>

1. Drain the soaked chickpeas and rinse them under running water. In a pressure cooker, add the chickpeas with enough water and a pinch of salt. Pressure cook for about 4-5 whistles or until the chickpeas are soft and cooked through. Set aside. <br>

2. Heat oil or ghee in a large pan or pot over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter. <br>

3. Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.<br>

4. Add ginger-garlic paste and green chilies. Sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.<br>

5. Add tomato puree or finely chopped tomatoes and cook until the oil starts to separate from the mixture.<br>

6. Reduce the heat to low and add coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, dried mango powder (amchur), and salt. Mix well and cook the masala for a couple of minutes.<br>

7. Add the cooked chickpeas to the masala and mix well until the chickpeas are coated with the spices.<br>

8. Pour some water (about 1 to 1.5 cups) to achieve your desired consistency. Let it simmer for 15-20 minutes on low heat, allowing the flavors to meld together. Adjust salt and spices as per taste.<br>

9. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves. Chole is ready to be served with Bhature.<br>

<br>

<i>Preparing Bhature (Fried Indian Bread):</i><br>

1. In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour (maida), semolina (sooji), baking powder, baking soda, and a pinch of salt.<br>

2. Add yogurt and oil to the dry ingredients and mix well to form a crumbly mixture.<br>

3. Gradually add water and knead the mixture into a smooth and soft dough. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 2 hours.<br>

4. After resting, divide the dough into small lemon-sized balls. Roll each ball into a circular disc using a rolling pin.<br>

5. Heat oil for deep frying in a deep pan or kadai over medium-high heat.<br>

6. Once the oil is hot, gently slide the rolled Bhature into the oil and fry until they puff up and turn golden brown on both sides. Flip them to ensure even frying.<br>

7. Remove the fried Bhature from the oil and place them on paper towels to absorb excess oil.<br>

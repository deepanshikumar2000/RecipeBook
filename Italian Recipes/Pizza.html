    <p>Homemade Margherita Pizza</p>
    
    <p><b><h5>Ingredients:</h5></b></p>

    <p><b><h5>For the pizza dough:</h5></b></p>
    - 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br>
    - 1 cup warm water<br>
    - 1 packet (2 1/4 tsp) active dry yeast<br>
    - 1 tsp sugar<br>
    - 1 tsp salt<br>
    - 2 tbsp olive oil<br>
    <br>
    <p><b><h5>For the pizza sauce:</h5></b></p>
    - 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes<br>
    - 2 cloves garlic, minced<br>
    - 1 tbsp olive oil<br>
    - 1 tsp dried oregano<br>
    - 1/2 tsp dried basil<br>
    - Salt and pepper to taste<br>
    <br>
    <p><b><h5>For the pizza toppings:</h5></b></p>
    - 8 oz fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced<br>
    - Fresh basil leaves<br>
    - Extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling<br>
    <br>
    <p><b><h5>Instructions:</h5></b></p>
    <p><b><h5>Prepare the pizza dough:</h5></b></p>
    1. In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.<br>
    
    2. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add the frothy yeast mixture and olive oil to the flour mixture.<br>
    
    3. Stir until the dough comes together, then transfer it to a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until you have a smooth and elastic dough.<br>
    
    4. Form the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover it with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 to 1.5 hours or until it doubles in size.<br>
    
    
    <p><b><h5>Prepare the pizza sauce:</h5></b></p>
    1. In a saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté for a minute or until fragrant.<br>
    
    2. Pour in the crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine.<br>
    
    3. Let the sauce simmer on low heat for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust the seasoning to your taste.<br>
    
  
    <p><b><h5>Assemble and bake the pizza:</h5></b></p>
    1. Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) or as high as your oven can go. If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.<br>
    
    2. Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal portions. Roll out each portion on a floured surface to your desired thickness.<br>
    
    3. Transfer the rolled-out dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet or a pizza peel if you're using a pizza stone.<br>
    
    4. Spread a generous amount of the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.<br>
    
    5. Add slices of fresh mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce.<br>
    
    6. Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown, and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.<br>
    
    7. Once out of the oven, top with fresh basil leaves and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil.<br>
    
    8. Slice and serve hot! Enjoy your homemade Margherita pizza!<br>
    
    Feel free to get creative with the toppings and adjust the recipe according to your preferences. Happy pizza-making!<br>
